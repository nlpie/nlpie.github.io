      <h1 class="display-3">University of Minnesota NLP/IE</h1>
      <p>The Natural Language Processing/Information Extraction program is a team of investigators at the University of Minnesota, Institute for Health Informatics. We use NLP/IE to process, extract, and encode information from unstructured biomedical and clinical texts, including clinical texts from the electronic health record. These techniques are then leveraged to support the invention of new healthcare and research applications and the investigation of healthcare interventions.</p>

      <p>We release many of our projects as free and open source software on our <a href="https://github.com/nlpie">GitHub organization page</a>.</p>
